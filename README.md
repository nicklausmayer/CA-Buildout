# CA-Buildout
Bash automated OpenSSL certificate generation script

I created this script origionally to create certificates faster for work and wanted to make it public, I've done a lot of work to the script and config files to ensure optimization of certificate generation and overall cleanliness.

The library script file includes all the neccessary workings of the script, while the main buildout script is the menu. Feel free to post issues to point out any mistakes and any ways I can improve the script!
